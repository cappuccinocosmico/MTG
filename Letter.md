I was upstairs yesterday, and Ms. Hampton came in and was asking me about the F I had in GT. I said that was due to a presentation that I had shared with him on April 29th to the wrong email, and had fixed it a couple days before that, at the time I remember him telling me that he would grade it soon, (he had told me his schedule was clear to grade it.) Ms. Hampton went downstairs to talk with him, I continued working on a bio worksheet, and Ms. Hampton had told me to come down, and I had appeared to be wrong about when I shared it, and that I never shared it with the other email. I told him that I did share the file copy, he then responded saying that this is just a classic case of me directing the blame onto someone else that "
>*I have never seen you take the blame for anything in this class... That if you had just admitted that It was your fault I would have accepted it for full credit.*

He then proceeded to remove it from the gradebook, saying that he would put it in for 1/2 credit. I went up to my computer upstairs and looked at the version history, and found out that I had shared it with him on the 29th (I reverted it and It wasn't shared with him.) Then I went to email him about it, asking him why the email didnt get to him.
